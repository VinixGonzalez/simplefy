            Cookies are small bits of text sent by our servers to your computer
            or device when you access our services. They are stored in your
            browser and later sent back to our servers so that we can provide
            contextual content. Without cookies, using the web would be a much
            more frustrating experience. We use them to support your activities
            on our website, for example your session (so you don't have to login
            again) or your shopping cart.

            Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based
            on previous or current activity on our website (the pages you have
            visited), your language and country, which enables us to provide you
            with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile
            aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we
            can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
